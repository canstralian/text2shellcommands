# Model Card for Model ID

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->

This model card aims to document the capabilities, performance, and intended usage of models fine-tuned for cybersecurity tasks, including shell command parsing and cyber exploit detection. It is based on the underlying models WhiteRabbitNeo-13B-v1 and replit-code-v1_5-3b, fine-tuned on datasets related to shell commands and exploit databases.

## Model Details

### Model Description

This model is a fine-tuned version of large-scale language models optimized for tasks such as parsing shell commands and analyzing cybersecurity exploits. The training leverages datasets such as Canstralian/ShellCommands and Canstralian/CyberExploitDB to provide domain-specific knowledge.

- **Developed by:** Canstralian (more details needed)
- **Funded by [optional]:** [More Information Needed]
- **Shared by [optional]:** [More Information Needed]
- **Model type:** Transformer-based Language Model for cybersecurity applications
- **Language(s) (NLP):** English (en)
- **License:** MIT
- **Finetuned from model [optional]:** WhiteRabbitNeo/WhiteRabbitNeo-13B-v1, replit/replit-code-v1_5-3b

### Model Sources [optional]

- **Repository:** [Add model repository URL here]
- **Paper [optional]:** [Link to relevant research paper]
- **Demo [optional]:** [Link to model demo or interface]

## Uses

### Direct Use

The model is intended to be used directly for tasks like:
- Shell command understanding and classification
- Analyzing and classifying cybersecurity exploit patterns
- Assisting with code generation and debugging in a cybersecurity context

### Downstream Use [optional]

When fine-tuned further, the model can be applied to:
- Automated incident response systems
- Security tool integration (e.g., for vulnerability scanners)
- Custom cybersecurity solutions tailored to enterprise needs

### Out-of-Scope Use

The model is not designed for general-purpose natural language understanding outside of its specified cybersecurity domain. It may perform poorly or inaccurately for tasks outside of:
- Shell command parsing
- Exploit database analysis
- Code generation for cybersecurity applications

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

This model may exhibit bias in the detection of certain exploits or shell commands, particularly if it encounters unfamiliar patterns not covered in the training data. Additionally, the model's predictions may be less accurate on unseen datasets or with edge cases that were not represented in the training data.

### Recommendations

- Users should be cautious when applying the model to novel or unverified exploits, as it may not handle new attack vectors well.
- Regular evaluation and testing in real-world environments are recommended before deploying the model in production.

## How to Get Started with the Model

Use the code below to get started with the model:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the pre-trained model
model_name = "Canstralian/WhiteRabbitNeo-13B-v1-finetuned"
nlp = pipeline("text-classification", model=model_name)

# Example usage
result = nlp("Example shell command or exploit input")
print(result)
```

## Training Details

### Training Data

The model was fine-tuned on the following datasets:
- **Canstralian/ShellCommands**: A collection of shell commands used in cybersecurity contexts.
- **Canstralian/CyberExploitDB**: A curated set of known exploits and vulnerabilities.

Further details on the preprocessing of these datasets can be found in their respective dataset cards.

### Training Procedure

#### Preprocessing [optional]

The data was preprocessed to remove any sensitive or personally identifiable information. Text normalization and tokenization were applied to ensure consistency across the datasets.

#### Training Hyperparameters

- **Training regime:** fp16 mixed precision

## Evaluation

### Testing Data, Factors & Metrics

#### Testing Data

Testing was performed on both synthetic and real-world shell command and exploit datasets, focusing on their ability to correctly parse shell commands and identify exploit signatures.

#### Factors

The evaluation factors included:
- Model performance across different types of shell commands and exploits.
- Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score in detecting known exploits.

#### Metrics

Metrics used for evaluation include:
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
- **Precision**: The number of relevant instances among the retrieved instances.

- **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

### Results

The model performs well on standard shell command parsing tasks and exploit detection, with high accuracy for common exploits. However, its performance may degrade on newer or less common exploits.

#### Summary

The model is well-suited for cybersecurity applications involving shell command and exploit detection. While it excels in these areas, users should monitor its performance for emerging threats and unusual attack patterns.
